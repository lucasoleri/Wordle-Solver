# Wordle-Solver
Wordle Solver based on Entropy
Project for my Natural Language Processing class, had to work on a solver for the New York times wordle game.
Solution in the guesser.py
You can run the script from the terminal downlaoding all the files, changing the name to the wordlist you want to use to only wordlist.yaml, and running    python game.py --r 10
